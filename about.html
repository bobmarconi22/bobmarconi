								<h3>Why I became a Software Engineer</h3>
								<p>Back in 2018 when I was a freshman in college, pursuing a degree in Business Management and Administration, I had a family friend tell me about the coding bootcamp that he was attending, I remember wondering "What the heck is a software engineer", and after about 5 minutes, and 2 total google searches later, I ironically thought "Whelp thats not for me".</p>

								<p>Fast Forward to 2023, I was selling cars at a dealership called Gateway Kia in Warrington, PA. and in the midst of one of the slowest months of any work I had ever experienced, I found myself looking for a new job, and as a then 23 year old, I was trying to find a career. I looked up "Best Jobs for people who like to learn" and one of the top results ended up being "Web Developer". Almost immediately I thought back to that conversation in college. One phone call later, that same family friend really explained what a software engineer is, and gave me a few free sites to try my hand at it and see how I felt. After about a month of doing free online programs and learning basic HTML and JS, I entirely fell in love with it. I immediately took the next steps by enrolling in a bootcamp, I couldn't wait to start! </p>

								<h4>More About Me</h4>
								<p>I am 24 years old, and I enjoy keeping busy! Many of my hobbies include: Spending time with my Fiance√© Gina, Playing/watching sports, Playing video games, and going out with friends and family. When I am not working on coding projects, or learning new things, I am almost certainly doing something on that list!</p>

								<p>I am located about 10 minutes from Philadelphia, so me and Gina will usually make day trips into the city to either walk around and enjoy the weather, or even go to events being hosted in the city. We also regularly go down to NJ to enjoy beach days! I played every sport imaginable growing up, but I still get out to throw around a Baseball and a Football here and there. I will watch any sport that's on TV, but will never miss a Phillies, Eagles, or Flyers game! I love 3rd person RPG games, particularly Red Dead Redemption 2 (Greatest game ever created), Ghost of Tsushima, and also play games like 2K, Madden, and most recently NCAA25. </p>
